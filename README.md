# Creating a server with node.js

We are going to be using Express, so when you clone the repo, you need to install the dependencies of the project so it can work.

To install the dependencies, run the following command:

<code>npm install</code>

Once you install the dependencies (Express), you will be able to run the server by following the command:

node app.js
